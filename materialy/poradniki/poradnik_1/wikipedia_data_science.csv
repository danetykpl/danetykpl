Data
science
is
an
interdisciplinary
academic
field
that
uses
statistics
scientific
computing
scientific
methods
processes
algorithms
and
systems
to
extract
or
extrapolate
knowledge
and
insights
from
noisy
structured
and
unstructured
data.Data
science
also
integrates
domain
knowledge
from
the
underlying
application
domain
e.g.
natural
sciences
information
technology
and
medicine
Data
science
is
multifaceted
and
can
be
described
as
a
science
a
research
paradigm
a
research
method
a
discipline
a
workflow
and
a
profession.Data
science
is
a
concept
to
unify
statistics
data
analysis
informatics
and
their
related
methods
to
understand
and
analyze
actual
phenomena
with
data
It
uses
techniques
and
theories
drawn
from
many
fields
within
the
context
of
mathematics
statistics
computer
science
information
science
and
domain
knowledge
However
data
science
is
different
from
computer
science
and
information
science
Turing
Award
winner
Jim
Gray
imagined
data
science
as
a
fourth
paradigm
of
science
empirical
theoretical
computational
and
now
data-driven
and
asserted
that
everything
about
science
is
changing
because
of
the
impact
of
information
technology
and
the
data
deluge.A
data
scientist
is
a
professional
who
creates
programming
code
and
combines
it
with
statistical
knowledge
to
create
insights
from
data
Foundations
Data
science
is
an
interdisciplinary
field
focused
on
extracting
knowledge
from
typically
large
data
sets
and
applying
the
knowledge
and
insights
from
that
data
to
solve
problems
in
a
wide
range
of
application
domains
The
field
encompasses
preparing
data
for
analysis
formulating
data
science
problems
analyzing
data
developing
data-driven
solutions
and
presenting
findings
to
inform
high-level
decisions
in
a
broad
range
of
application
domains
As
such

users
should
be
able
to
intuitively
control
and
explore
data
In
2015
the
American
Statistical
Association
identified
database
management
statistics
and
machine
learning
and
distributed
and
parallel
systems
as
the
three
emerging
foundational
professional
communities
Relationship
to
statistics
Many
statisticians
including
Nate
Silver
have
argued
that
data
science
is
not
a
new
field
but
rather
another
name
for
statistics
Others
argue
that
data
science
is
distinct
from
statistics
because
it
focuses
on
problems
and
techniques
unique
to
digital
data
Vasant
Dhar
writes
that
statistics
emphasizes
quantitative
data
and
description
In
contrast
data
science
deals
with
quantitative
and
qualitative
data
e.g.
from
images
text
sensors
transactions
customer
information
etc
and
emphasizes
prediction
and
action
Andrew
Gelman
of
Columbia
University
has
described
statistics
as
a
non-essential
part
of
data
science.Stanford
professor
David
Donoho
writes
that
data
science
is
not
distinguished
from
statistics
by
the
size
of
datasets
or
use
of
computing
and
that
many
graduate
programs
misleadingly
advertise
their
analytics
and
statistics
training
as
the
essence
of
a
data-science
program
He
describes
data
science
as
an
applied
field
growing
out
of
traditional
statistics
Etymology
Early
usage
In
1962
John
Tukey
described
a
field
he
called
data
analysis
which
resembles
modern
data
science
In
1985
in
a
lecture
given
to
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
in
Beijing
C.
F.
Jeff
Wu
used
the
term
data
science
for
the
first
time
as
an
alternative
name
for
statistics
Later
attendees
at
a
1992
statistics
symposium
at
the
University
of
Montpellier
II
acknowledged
the
emergence
of
a
new
discipline
focused
on
data
of
various
origins
and
forms
combining
established
concepts
and
principles
of
statistics
and
data
analysis
with
computing.The
term
data
science
has
been
traced
back
to
1974
when
Peter
Naur
proposed
it
as
an
alternative
name
to
computer
science
In
1996
the
International
Federation
of
Classification
Societies
became
the
first
conference
to
specifically
feature
data
science
as
a
topic
However
the
definition
was
still
in
flux
After
the
1985
lecture
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
in
Beijing
in
1997
C.
F.
Jeff
Wu
again
suggested
that
statistics
should
be
renamed
data
science
He
reasoned
that
a
new
name
would
help
statistics
shed
inaccurate
stereotypes
such
as
being
synonymous
with
accounting
or
limited
to
describing
data
In
1998
Hayashi
Chikio
argued
for
data
science
as
a
new
interdisciplinary
concept
with
three
aspects
data
design
collection
and
analysis.During
the
1990s
popular
terms
for
the
process
of
finding
patterns
in
datasets
which
were
increasingly
large
included
knowledge
discovery
and
data
mining
Modern
usage
In
2012
technologists
Thomas
H.
Davenport
and
DJ
Patil
declared
Data
Scientist
The
Sexiest
Job
of
the
21st
Century
a
catchphrase
that
was
picked
up
even
by
major-city
newspapers
like
the
New
York
Times
and
the
Boston
Globe
A
decade
later
they
reaffirmed
it
stating
that
the
job
is
more
in
demand
than
ever
with
employers
.The
modern
conception
of
data
science
as
an
independent
discipline
is
sometimes
attributed
to
William
S.
Cleveland
In
a
2001
paper
he
advocated
an
expansion
of
statistics
beyond
theory
into
technical
areas
because
this
would
significantly
change
the
field
it
warranted
a
new
name
Data
science
became
more
widely
used
in
the
next
few
years
in
2002
the
Committee
on
Data
for
Science
and
Technology
launched
the
Data
Science
Journal
In
2003
Columbia
University
launched
The
Journal
of
Data
Science
In
2014
the
American
Statistical
Association
's
Section
on
Statistical
Learning
and
Data
Mining
changed
its
name
to
the
Section
on
Statistical
Learning
and
Data
Science
reflecting
the
ascendant
popularity
of
data
science.The
professional
title
of
data
scientist
has
been
attributed
to
DJ
Patil
and
Jeff
Hammerbacher
in
2008
Though
it
was
used
by
the
National
Science
Board
in
their
2005
report
Long-Lived
Digital
Data
Collections
Enabling
Research
and
Education
in
the
21st
Century
it
referred
broadly
to
any
key
role
in
managing
a
digital
data
collection.There
is
still
no
consensus
on
the
definition
of
data
science
and
it
is
considered
by
some
to
be
a
buzzword
Big
data
is
a
related
marketing
term
Data
scientists
are
responsible
for
breaking
down
big
data
into
usable
information
and
creating
software
and
algorithms
that
help
companies
and
organizations
determine
optimal
operations
Data
Science
and
Data
Analysis
Data
science
and
data
analysis
are
both
important
disciplines
in
the
field
of
data
management
and
analysis
but
they
differ
in
several
key
ways
While
both
fields
involve
working
with
data
data
science
is
more
of
an
interdisciplinary
field
that
involves
the
application
of
statistical
computational
and
machine
learning
methods
to
extract
insights
from
data
and
make
predictions
while
data
analysis
is
more
focused
on
the
examination
and
interpretation
of
data
to
identify
patterns
and
trends.Data
analysis
typically
involves
working
with
smaller
structured
datasets
to
answer
specific
questions
or
solve
specific
problems
This
can
involve
tasks
such
as
data
cleaning
data
visualization
and
exploratory
data
analysis
to
gain
insights
into
the
data
and
develop
hypotheses
about
relationships
between
variables
Data
analysts
typically
use
statistical
methods
to
test
these
hypotheses
and
draw
conclusions
from
the
data
For
example
a
data
analyst
might
analyze
sales
data
to
identify
trends
in
customer
behavior
and
make
recommendations
for
marketing
strategies.Data
science
on
the
other
hand
is
a
more
complex
and
iterative
process
that
involves
working
with
larger
more
complex
datasets
that
often
require
advanced
computational
and
statistical
methods
to
analyze
Data
scientists
often
work
with
unstructured
data
such
as
text
or
images
and
use
machine
learning
algorithms
to
build
predictive
models
and
make
data-driven
decisions
In
addition
to
statistical
analysis
data
science
often
involves
tasks
such
as
data
preprocessing
feature
engineering
and
model
selection
For
instance
a
data
scientist
might
develop
a
recommendation
system
for
an
e-commerce
platform
by
analyzing
user
behavior
patterns
and
using
machine
learning
algorithms
to
predict
user
preferences.While
data
analysis
focuses
on
extracting
insights
from
existing
data
data
science
goes
beyond
that
by
incorporating
the
development
and
implementation
of
predictive
models
to
make
informed
decisions
Data
scientists
are
often
responsible
for
collecting
and
cleaning
data
selecting
appropriate
analytical
techniques
and
deploying
models
in
real-world
scenarios
They
work
at
the
intersection
of
mathematics
computer
science
and
domain
expertise
to
solve
complex
problems
and
uncover
hidden
patterns
in
large
datasets.Despite
these
differences
data
science
and
data
analysis
are
closely
related
fields
and
often
require
similar
skill
sets
Both
fields
require
a
solid
foundation
in
statistics
programming
and
data
visualization
as
well
as
the
ability
to
communicate
findings
effectively
to
both
technical
and
non-technical
audiences
Moreover
both
fields
benefit
from
critical
thinking
and
domain
knowledge
as
understanding
the
context
and
nuances
of
the
data
is
essential
for
accurate
analysis
and
modeling.In
summary
data
analysis
and
data
science
are
distinct
yet
interconnected
disciplines
within
the
broader
field
of
data
management
and
analysis
Data
analysis
focuses
on
extracting
insights
and
drawing
conclusions
from
structured
data
while
data
science
involves
a
more
comprehensive
approach
that
combines
statistical
analysis
computational
methods
and
machine
learning
to
extract
insights
build
predictive
models
and
drive
data-driven
decision-making
Both
fields
play
vital
roles
in
leveraging
the
power
of
data
to
understand
patterns
make
informed
decisions
and
solve
complex
problems
across
various
domains
